# Py_Automation
Python automation

This script requires parimiko which also needs pycrypto.

To install run:

pip install pycrypto\n
pip install paramiko

pycrypto can be tricky to install on ubuntu as it often complains of missing files even when a c compiler is installed.
If you are havving issues install the following.

apt-cache search python3-dev
apt-get install python3-dev
apt-get install python-dev
